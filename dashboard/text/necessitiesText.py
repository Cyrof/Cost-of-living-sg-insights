NECESSITIES_CPI="The overall trend shows a steady increase in the CPI for all categories over the given period. The Transport (orange) segment appears to be the largest contributor to the CPI each year, consistently occupying the most significant portion of each bar. There are no significant anomalies or outliers within the data, as all categories show expected increases without any drastic spikes or drops."
NECESSITIES_CPI_Short="CPI steadily rose, led by transport, with no major anomalies."
CPI_AGAINST_INCOME="The most striking trend is the significant and consistent increase in income, represented by the solid purple line. It shows a modest rise from 2014 until about 2020, followed by a more rapid ascent from 2021 onwards, indicating substantial economic growth or improvements in wage levels during the latter half of the observed period. Generally, the CPI of necessities has been consistently stable from 2014 until 2020 before gradually increasing. The spike in Health Care costs starting in 2020 is an anomaly within this data set, which could be attributed to external factors such as healthcare reforms, changes in policy, or increased demand for medical services."
CPI_AGAINST_INCOME_Short="Income surged post-2020, while necessity CPI remained stable until a gradual rise, with a notable healthcare spike."
MONTHLY_EXPENDITURE="The composition of Monthly Expenditure has remained relatively stable over time, with the components that historically occupied the largest and smallest portions continuing to do so. This consistency indicates that the average distribution of expenditures has not significantly changed."
MONTHLY_EXPENDITURE_Short="Monthly spending proportions remained consistent despite changing economic factors."
NECESSITIES_RECO="We recommend that the government continue its efforts to ensure that the prices of necessities remain affordable. One approach could involve implementing economic policies such as price ceilings on essential goods and services to prevent excessive cost increases. Additionally, the government should consider expanding support for lower and middle-income groups, potentially through the enhancement of GST voucher schemes, which have been successfully implemented since 2023. By controlling the prices of essential goods and providing subsidies, the government can increase the purchasing power of residents. This strategy not only aids in managing the cost of living but also contributes to the country's GDP by boosting the consumption component of Singaporeâ€™s Real GDP. Overall, the Singaporean government is on the right track, effectively supporting Singaporeans in managing the rising cost of living."
