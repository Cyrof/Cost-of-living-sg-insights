NECESSITIES_CPI_SHORT_1 = "Overall CPI of necessities has steadily been rising."
NECESSITIES_CPI_SHORT_2 = "Transportation costs have had the largest increase over the years."
NECESSITIES_CPI_SHORT_3 = "Food costs have seen slight increases, which could be a point of financial strain on households."
NECESSITIES_CPI_SHORT_4 = "Healthcare costs have also seen a slight upward trend, which could pose challenges for those with chronic conditions or limited access to subsidised healthcare."
NECESSITIES_CPI_1 = "The chart reveals a concerning trend of rising costs, which may impact affordability and the overall cost of living. The CPI has a steady upward trajectory, which could indicate that residents are facing increasing expenses for fundamental needs. Housing and utilities consistently constitute a major component of the CPI, highlighting a potential financial burden associated with housing costs, including rent, utilities and maintenance. This is particularly concerning in a densely populated city-state like Singapore, where housing affordability is a persistent challenge."
NECESSITIES_CPI_2 = "Furthermore, rising food costs, reflected in the increasing CPI for food, could add to the financial strain faced by households, especially those with lower incomes who allocate a larger proportion of their budget to food. The healthcare component of the CPI also exhibits an upward trend, indicating rising healthcare expenses, which can pose challenges for individuals and families in managing healthcare costs, especially those with chronic conditions or limited access to subsidised healthcare. Transportation costs appear to have the largest increase over the years, which is a huge concern considering that citizens are highly dependent on Singapore’s public transport system. This upward trend in the CPI for basic necessities could suggest growing affordability challenges faced by Singaporean residents, potentially impacting their quality of life and economic well-being."

CPI_AGAINST_INCOME_SHORT_1 = "The incomes of Singaporeans have seen substantial growth, especially post-2020."
CPI_AGAINST_INCOME_SHORT_2 = "However, the costs of essential goods and services have also been on the rise."
CPI_AGAINST_INCOME_SHORT_3 = "Transport costs, in particular, have had a steep increase in recent years, suggesting that transportation-related expenses are contributing significantly to the overall cost of living."
CPI_AGAINST_INCOME_1 = "The analysis of income and expenditure trends in Singapore from 2014 to 2024 reveals a complex dynamic. While average incomes have seen substantial growth, the cost of essential goods and services has also been on the rise. This is particularly evident in categories such as food, housing and utilities and healthcare, which have experienced marked increases, especially after 2020. Notably, we observe a steep increase in transport costs, suggesting that rising fuel prices and other transportation-related expenses are contributing significantly to the overall cost of living."
CPI_AGAINST_INCOME_2 = "These upward trends in essential expenses suggest that despite rising wages, affordability challenges may be intensifying for some Singaporean households, particularly those with lower incomes or larger families. The graph highlights the need for policymakers and other stakeholders to closely monitor these trends and consider targeted interventions to mitigate the impact of rising costs on vulnerable populations. While the overall economic picture is positive with rising incomes, the escalating costs of essential goods and services, particularly food, housing, healthcare and transportation, warrant attention to ensure a sustainable and equitable standard of living for all Singaporeans."

MONTHLY_EXPENDITURE_SHORT_1 = "Food and transportation account for the biggest percentages of monthly expenses, and their monthly expenditure has been steadily growing."
MONTHLY_EXPENDITURE_SHORT_2 = "Healthcare costs have seen gradual but consistent growth."
MONTHLY_EXPENDITURE_SHORT_3 = "Over the years, the spending habits of Singaporeans have remained stable, suggesting that rising costs have not forced Singaporeans to sacrifice expenditures in specific categories."
MONTHLY_EXPENDITURE_1 = "The composition of Monthly Expenditure has remained relatively stable over time, with the components that historically occupied the largest and smallest portions continuing to do so. This consistency indicates that the average distribution of expenditures has not significantly changed.ingapore's monthly expenditure breakdowns for 2012–13, 2017–18, and 2023 show consistent patterns in the amount spent on necessities. Food and transportation typically account for the biggest percentages of monthly expenses, and their monetary expenditure has been steadily growing. Similarly, housing remains a significant expenditure category, and while its proportion has seen a slight decrease, the absolute monetary value spent on housing has increased, which underscores  the persistent challenge of housing affordability. Healthcare expenditure, while initially a smaller proportion, exhibits a concerning trend of gradual but consistent growth. This indicates a growing financial burden of healthcare, which could be especially concerning for those with chronic conditions or limited access to subsidised healthcare."
MONTHLY_EXPENDITURE_2 = "Despite these rising costs, the overall proportion of expenditure dedicated to these four key categories — food, transport, housing, and healthcare — suggests that while the absolute monetary values spent on these necessities have increased, their relative shares of household budgets have remained relatively stable. This implies that rising costs in these areas have not drastically altered overall spending patterns or forced significant sacrifices in other expenditure categories. However, the sustained dominance of these essential expenses highlights their importance in household budgets."

NECESSITIES_RECO = "We recommend that the government continue its efforts to ensure that the prices of necessities remain affordable. One approach could involve implementing economic policies such as price ceilings on essential goods and services to prevent excessive cost increases. Additionally, the government should consider expanding support for lower and middle-income groups, potentially through the enhancement of GST voucher schemes, which have been successfully implemented since 2023. By controlling the prices of essential goods and providing subsidies, the government can increase the purchasing power of residents. This strategy not only aids in managing the cost of living but also contributes to the country's GDP by boosting the consumption component of Singapore’s real GDP. Overall, the Singaporean government appears to be on the right track at effectively supporting Singaporeans in managing the rising cost of living."
