CPI_OVER_TIME="We implemented a world bubble map with a slider to effectively visualize the Consumer Price Index (CPI) of various countries over time. Given Singapore’s small geographical size, we used bubble size to represent the CPI and highlighted Singapore’s bubble with a distinct border for easy identification. The inclusion of a year slider allows users to track global CPI changes over time, with specific CPI values displayed next to each bubble for enhanced clarity. A detailed examination of Singapore’s CPI fluctuations across the years 2014, 2019, and 2023 reveals a general increase, likely influenced by global supply chain disruptions and pandemic-related impacts on multiple economic sectors, which could lead to heightened expenses for Singaporean households."
CPI_OVER_TIME_Short="Global CPI map shows Singapore's rising CPI, influenced by global events."
GDP_OVER_TIME=" Similarly, we chose a bubble map to represent GDP per capita, allowing for a global comparison while ensuring Singapore's prominence on the map. This map uses bubble size to denote GDP per capita, providing an intuitive visual representation of economic performance across countries. From 2014 to 2023, Singapore exhibited a significant increase in GDP per capita, indicative of rising average income levels and potential improvements in living standards. Compared to other nations, Singapore's growth rate is comparatively high, trailing only Ireland’s exceptional surge. In contrast, countries like South Africa have seen a decline in GDP per capita."
GDP_OVER_TIME_Short=" Singapore's GDP per capita grew significantly, second only to Ireland, while some countries declined."
CPI_GDP_OVER_TIME="For a comparative analysis, we utilized another bubble chart depicting GDP per capita against CPI for various countries. This chart demonstrates that ideally, GDP per capita growth should ourpace CPI growth, which signifies improved living standards. In Singapore, the GDP per capita growth generally surpasses CPI growth, indicating a boost in real purchasing power and a relatively stable cost of living environment compared to nations like the United Kingdom and Morocco, where CPI growth often outpaces GDP per capita growth. This positive trend in Singapore parallels Ireland’s performance in maintaining strong purchasing power."
CPI_GDP_OVER_TIME_Short="Singapore's GDP growth beats CPI, showing strong purchasing power; invest for sustainability."
GLOBAL_RECO="In response to these findings, we recommend prioritizing investments in innovation and technology to foster economic development and boost productivity, thereby sustaining Singapore's trend of GDP per capita growth outpacing CPI inflation. Developing human capital through enhanced education and skills training is critical to equipping the workforce for higher-paying positions. Vigilant monitoring of CPI trends is essential to implementing timely measures that mitigate inflationary pressures, particularly for essential goods and services. Additionally, strengthening labor market regulations to ensure fair wages, protect workers' rights, and promote continuous skills development will support a sustainable and inclusive economic environment where income growth keeps pace with rising living costs, thus preserving robust purchasing power."
