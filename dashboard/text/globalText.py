    "Singapore's CPI has seen fluctuations, but is generally on a rising trend."

CPI_OVER_TIME_SHORT_2 = (
    "The CPI of other countries have also seen increases, albeit at varying rates."
)
CPI_OVER_TIME_SHORT_3 = (
    "Fluctuations and increases could have been caused by global disruptions such as the COVID-19 pandemic."
)
CPI_OVER_TIME_1 = "The bubble maps provide a comparative overview of Singapore's CPI relative to other countries in 2014, 2019 and 2023. A larger bubble in the chart indicates a higher CPI. Focusing solely on Singapore's bubble, we can observe fluctuations in its size across the years, indicating changes in its CPI level relative to other nations."
CPI_OVER_TIME_2 = "In Singaporeâ€™s case, its CPI appears to have increased, suggesting a rise in its overall cost of goods and services. The CPIs of other countries have also faced similar increases, though at varying rates. Chronic global supply chain problems, particularly those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, had an important impact on pricing in utilities, housing, food and healthcare. These disruptions, together with the pandemic's impact on demand and job markets, could have resulted in an increase in average expenditure for Singaporean households. A rising CPI means that Singaporean residents are likely facing increased expenses for essential goods and services, potentially affecting their affordability and overall financial well-being. "

GDP_OVER_TIME_SHORT_1 = "Singapore's GDP per capita has grown significantly from 2014 to 2023, second only to Ireland."
GDP_OVER_TIME_SHORT_2 = "Most other countries see a similar rise in GDP per capita."
GDP_OVER_TIME_SHORT_3 = "However, the GDP of some countries, such as South Africa, declined."
GDP_OVER_TIME_1 = "Singapore's substantial increase in GDP per capita, from 2014 to 2023, suggests a rise in average income and potential improvements in living standards, such as access to better healthcare, education and infrastructure. Therefore, we can conclude that Singapore's rising GDP per capita signifies economic growth that generally correlates with improved Standard of Living (SOL) for its people."
GDP_OVER_TIME_2 = "Although most other countries see a similar rise in GDP per capita, certain countries, however, face a declining GDP per capita, such as South Africa. Furthermore, the rate of increase in GDP per capita for Singapore appears to be much higher than most countries, bar Ireland, whose GDP per capita has increased at an astonishing pace."

CPI_GDP_OVER_TIME_SHORT_1 = "Singapore's GDP growth has generally outpaced its CPI growth, showing rising purchasing power."
CPI_GDP_OVER_TIME_SHORT_2 = "Notably, Ireland has also experienced GDP growth outpacing CPI growth."
CPI_GDP_OVER_TIME_SHORT_3 = "Countries like the United Kingdom and Morocco experience the opposite, with CPI growth outpacing GDP growth."
CPI_GDP_OVER_TIME_1 = "Ideally, GDP per capita growth should surpass CPI growth, which would indicate rising real incomes and improved living standards. Conversely, when CPI growth outpaces GDP per capita growth, purchasing power is eroded, potentially leading to a decline in living standards."
CPI_GDP_OVER_TIME_2 = "In Singapore, GDP per capita growth has generally exceeded CPI growth, suggesting that average incomes have risen faster than the general price level. This implies an overall increase in real purchasing power for Singaporeans, indicating a relative improvement in their cost of living despite inflationary pressures. While a perception of poor financial sustainability in Singapore persists due to rising prices (as reflected in CPI trends), the robust GDP per capita growth bolsters these cost pressures. This contrasts with countries like the United Kingdom and Morocco, where CPI growth often surpasses GDP per capita growth. Singapore's experience aligns more closely with nations like Ireland, which exhibit similar positive trends in real purchasing power."
CPI_GDP_OVER_TIME_3 = "Therefore, while inflationary pressures are present, the sustained growth of GDP per capita relative to CPI in Singapore suggests that economic growth has generally translated into enhanced affordability of goods and services, fostering a relatively robust cost of living environment compared to many other nations."

GLOBAL_RECO_1 = "We advise the government to make investments in innovation and technology top priority in order to boost economic development and productivity and sustain Singapore's favourable trend of GDP per capita growth above CPI inflation. At the same time, creating human capital via education and skill development would guarantee a workforce prepared for higher-paying positions."
GLOBAL_RECO_2 = "Timely measures to control inflationary pressures, especially in essential products and services, can be made possible by closely monitoring CPI movements. A sustainable and inclusive economy with strong purchasing power can also be achieved by bolstering labour market regulations that uphold fair salaries, safeguard workers' rights and encourage skill development. This will help guarantee that income growth keeps up with or surpasses growing prices."
