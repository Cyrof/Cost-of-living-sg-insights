INTRO_1 = "The rising cost of living in Singapore is a persistent concern among its citizens, with perceptions of increasing taxes and the costs of necessities, healthcare, and other essential goods and services. Our objective is to investigate whether Singapore is becoming less economically viable, as perceived by many, and to assess the effectiveness of government policies aimed at maintaining a fair and sustainable standard of living."
INTRO_2 = "We hypothesize that the cost of living in Singapore has been rising disproportionately to income growth, potentially creating affordability challenges and impacting the standard of living for certain segments of the population."
INTRO_BULLET_1 = "The cost of necessities, including housing, food, healthcare, and transportation, has been rising according to CPI trends."
INTRO_BULLET_2 = "Healthcare expenditures are exhibiting an upward trend, potentially affecting access to and affordability of healthcare services."
INTRO_BULLET_3 = "While incomes have generally increased, the rate of growth has often felt insufficient to keep pace with the rising cost of living, leading to a sense of financial strain."
INTRO_3 = "To confirm the validity of these hypotheses and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate dynamics affecting Singapore's cost of living, this study will examine these topics in further detail by analyzing a range of economic indicators and policy initiatives."
